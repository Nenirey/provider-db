To enable using Zoho Mail, you have to turn on IMAP Access:

1. Log into Zoho Mail on the web and navigate to [Settings > Mail Accounts](https://mail.zoho.eu/zm/#settings/all/mailaccounts)
2. There should be check box for imap access so tick that

These instructions are also on [this Zoho Mail help page](https://www.zoho.com/mail/help/imap-access.html#EnableIMAPAccess)

You should also make sure that you specify the mail server manually since going with the defaults may result in errors.
